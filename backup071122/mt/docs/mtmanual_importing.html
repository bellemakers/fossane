<h1><a name="importing your entries"></a>IMPORTING YOUR ENTRIES</h1>
<p>Movable Type allows you to import your entries from other weblog content
management systems. If you are importing from Greymatter, Movable Type also
allows you to import all of the comments on your entries into your new weblog.
This can be useful when you wish to start using Movable Type but already have
much of your content in another system. To do this, you will first need to
export your data from the other system; you can do this using the other
system's standard templating functionality. Simply use a template that will
produce the desired formatting that Movable Type understands for importing
new entries. Templates for exporting data from Blogger, Greymatter, and Newspro
are provided below.</p>
<a name="mt_export"></a><p>In addition to exporting your data from another weblog CMS, you can export
your entries from Movable Type itself. This allows you to keep local backups
of your weblog content for safekeeping, as well as to transfer data between
weblogs, by combining the export and import mechanisms. To export the entries
from one of your weblogs, login to Movable Type, then go to the <code>Main Menu</code> for
the weblog you wish to export. Then click <code>Import &amp; Export Entries</code>, and
follow the instructions under <code>Export Entries</code>.</p>
<a name="export_ie"></a><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> be careful when exporting data from Internet Explorer; all versions of
Internet Explorer have a bug where data marked as plain text can be intrepreted
as HTML. The symptom of this bug is that all of your exported data will run
together onto one line. If this is the case, use Netscape when exporting data.</p>
<p>After your content has been exported from the other system, you must move
your data files over to the system where Movable Type runs, so that Movable
Type can find them. Then you can use the import mechanism to import those
entries into Movable Type.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Log into your Blogger account, then switch into template-editing mode.
<p></p>
<li>
Make a copy of your current template; you will be replacing your Blogger
template with the conversion template in Step 3, but you probably don't want
to lose your original template.
<p></p>
<li>
Replace your Blogger template with the following.
<pre>&lt;Blogger&gt;
AUTHOR: &lt;$BlogItemAuthor$&gt;
DATE: &lt;$BlogItemDateTime$&gt;
-----
BODY:
&lt;$BlogItemBody$&gt;
--------
&lt;/Blogger&gt;
</pre><p>NOTE: if you are exporting from Blogger Pro, add this line before the
<code>AUTHOR:</code> line:</p>
<pre>TITLE: &lt;PostSubject&gt;&lt;$BlogItemSubject$&gt;&lt;/PostSubject&gt;
</pre><p></p>
<li>
Enter the Settings area for this weblog.
<p></p>
<li>
Change your <code>Blog Filename</code> to a different filename; this will prevent
you from overwriting your main index file.
<p></p>
<li>
In <code>Formatting</code>, set your weblog to display all of your posts on the main
index page. There is no explicit setting for this; instead, you should
change the number of days displayed on your front page (<code>Show N days' posts
on main page</code>) higher than the number of days that you have been weblogging.
<p></p>
<li>
Set <code>Date/Time Format</code> to the format <code>MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM|PM</code>. (Note:
the format will not look like this in the menu; instead it will be the
current time, formatted.)
<p></p>
<li>
Set <code>Convert Line Breaks</code> to <code>No</code>.
<p></p>
<li>
Set <code>Archive Frequency</code> to <code>No Archive</code>. This will prevent your archives
from being overwritten with the new template.
<p></p>
<li>
Switch back to the Posts screen, and <code>Publish</code> your weblog. You will end up
with a single file with all of your posts, formatted using the above template,
at the location specified in your Settings. Download this file to your local
hard drive.
<p>Now skip down to <a href="#importing entries">Importing Entries</a>, below.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>

<h2><a name="exporting greymatter comments only"></a>Exporting Greymatter Comments Only</h2>
<p>If you have already imported your Greymatter entries into Movable Type, and
now wish to import just the comments from those entries, you can do this
using the following steps. Note that these instructions will only work if:</p>
<ol>
<li>
You have already imported all of your Greymatter entries into Movable Type.
<p></p>
<li>
You have not changed the timestamps (<code>Authored on</code> dates) on those entries
after importing them; Movable Type will use the entry timestamps to determine
which comments match up with which entries. Thus, if you have changed the
timestamp on an entry, Movable Type will not be able to match up any comments
on that entry.
<p></p></ol>
<p>Here are the steps for exporting just your Greymatter comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Log into your Greymatter account, then click <code>Edit Templates</code>; then click
<code>Edit Main Index-Related Templates</code>.

this line. Ensure that the date format is MM/DD/YYYY (2-digit month/2-digit
day/4-digit year).
<p>Now skip down to <a href="#importing entries">Importing Entries</a>, below.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>
<h2><a name="importing entries"></a>Importing Entries</h2>
<p>Now that you have exported all of your entries from your other content
management system, you are ready to import the entries into Movable Type.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Connect to your FTP server; then open the directory where you installed
Movable Type.
<p></p>
<li>
Create a new directory called <i>import</i>, then open that directory.
<p></p>
<li>
Upload the file containing all of your entries into the <i>import</i> directory.
<p></p>
<li>
Log into Movable Type, then select the weblog into which you wish to import the
entries from the <code>Your existing weblogs</code> list.
<p></p>
<li>
Click <code>Import Entries</code>.
<p></p>
<li>
<a name="import_as_self"></a><p>You have the option of either importing the entries as yourself--the author
that you are currently logged in as--or creating new authors for each
author name found in the original set of entries. For example, if your weblog
is/was a team weblog, you would probably want to recreate the original set of
authors, rather than import all of the entries as yourself. Otherwise you
probably wish to simply import the entries as yourself.</p>
<p>If importing the entries as you, check the <code>Import as me</code> box.</p>
<p>If creating new authors, you will need to set a password which will be
used when creating each of the new authors in the system. You should also
leave the <code>Import as me</code> box unchecked.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if the name of an author listed for one of the entries you are
importing is already being used by an author in the Movable Type system, the
entry will be assigned to the existing author, and a new author will not be
created.</p>
<li>
<a name="import_category"></a><p>If you would like to choose a default category for all of the entries that
you import, you can do so here. This might be useful if you already have a
batch of entries in your Movable Type weblog, for example, and you wish to mark
the newly-imported entries as uncategorized.</p>
<p>If you do not choose a default category, the entries will not be assigned to a
particular category (unless the entries you are importing use the <code>CATEGORY</code>
key to specify their category).</p>
<p>If you choose a default category, and one or more entries use the <code>CATEGORY</code>
key in the list of exported entries, the <code>CATEGORY</code> key will override the
default category, for those entries using the <code>CATEGORY</code> key; all other
entries will be assigned to the default category.</p>
<li>
<a name="import_status"></a><p>By default, your imported entries will be assigned the post status that you
have selected as the <code>Status default</code> in your weblog configuration. If you
would like to override this, you can select the desired post status
(<code>Draft</code> or <code>Publish</code>) from the <code>Default post status for entries</code> menu.</p>
<li>
<a name="import_title_html"></a><p>The <code>Title Start HTML</code> and <code>Title End HTML</code> values are used to identify
a post title within the body of an entry. This is useful when importing
entries from Blogger, for example, because Blogger posts do not have the
concept of a separate title field. If you have named your posts consistently
through the use of HTML tags, however, Movable Type can parse your weblog
entries to find those titles. For example, if all of your entry titles look
like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;font class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;I am a title&lt;/font&gt;
</pre><p>Then you could use a value for <code>Title Start HTML</code> of</p>
<pre>&lt;font class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
</pre><p>and a value for <code>Title End HTML</code> of</p>
<pre>&lt;/font&gt;
</pre><p>to automatically set the titles of your entries when importing. If found,
the title, along with the surrounding HTML, will be removed from the body
of your entry.</p>
<p>If you do not fill in these values, or if the relevant HTML cannot be found
for a particular entry, the first five (5) words of the entry are used as
the title, instead.</p>
<li>
After filling in the necessary values in the form, press <code>IMPORT</code> to import
your entries.
<p></p>
<li>
That's it!
<p><i>NOTE</i>: You should now remove all of the files that you imported from the
<i>import</i> directory, so that if or when you run the import process again at
some later date, the entries you just imported will not be re-imported.</p>
<p>You will need to rebuild all of your files in order to generate your archives
for the new imported entries.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> after importing your entries, if you imported them from a system
without categories, you may wish to assign categories to each of your entries;
a fast way to do this is to use Movable Type's
<a href="./mtmanual_entries.html#powerediting mode">Power-Editing Mode</a>, which allows you
to edit multiple entries at once.</p>
