<h1><a name="entries"></a>ENTRIES</h1>
<p>Entries form the basis of your weblog; they are the content, whereas the
templates (below) generally define how that content appears. You can create
a new entry by logging in to Movable Type, selecting a weblog, then clicking
<code>Create New Entry</code>. You can edit your existing entries by clicking <code>List
&amp; Edit Entries</code>, then selecting an entry from that list.</p>
<p>When creating a new entry, you will have the chance to set the following
fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Title"></a>Title</strong><br>

The title of your entry does not necessarily have to appear on your weblog;
it is required, however, for sorting and display purposes in Movable Type
itself.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Primary_Category"></a>Primary Category</strong><br>

You can choose a primary category for your post for categorization or
archiving purposes. Movable Type supports entries assigned to multiple
categories, but there must always be one category that is the primary category
for each entry; this allows you to use tags like <code>&lt;$MTEntryCategory$&gt;</code>
to display information about a single category.
<p>For more information on managing categories, see
<a href="./mtmanual_categories.html">CATEGORIES</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Entry_Body"></a>Entry Body</strong><br>

<li><strong><a name="item_Extended_Entry"></a>Extended Entry</strong><br>

Collectively these two fields make up the body of your entry. You can use
the two fields however you like: you could split up your entry over the two
fields, or you could completely ignore the <a href="#item_Extended_Entry"><code>Extended Entry</code></a> text and enter only
the <a href="#item_Entry_Body"><code>Entry Body</code></a> text. Movable Type allows you to split up your entry for
more flexibility in the display of that entry; for example, if you write very
long entries, you may not want your entire entry on your index pages. You
can use the two fields to control what gets displayed, and where.
<p>Note that when the text of your entry and extended entry fields are output
into your public weblog, paragraphs--blocks of text separated by two line
breaks--will be automatically converted using the <i>Text Formatting</i>
option you have selected. The default formatting is to enclose paragraphs
within <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p</code>&gt;&gt; tags, and to convert line breaks
to <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags. If you do not want this formatting to occur,
you can select <code>None</code> for the text formatting.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Excerpt"></a>Excerpt</strong><br>

You can enter an excerpt from your entry, or use this field to provide a
summary of the content therein. If you do not provide an excerpt, it will
be automatically generated (when specified in a template using the
<code>MTEntryExcerpt</code> tag) by selecting the first twenty (20) words from your
entry, followed by an ellipsis.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Keywords"></a>Keywords</strong><br>

The Keywords field can hold whatever type of data you want to put in it; it
is geared for holding metadata or keywords about your entry, and is not
normally displayed on your public site (though you can display it using the
<code>&lt;$MTEntryKeywords$&gt;</code> tag). It is searched when a user performs a
public search on your site, so you can use it to tag entries with words
that may not normally appear in the entry body.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Post_Status"></a>Post Status</strong><br>

Entries with <code>Status</code> set to <code>Draft</code> will not be published to your weblog.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Allow_Comments"></a>Allow Comments</strong><br>

Specifies whether you would like users to be able to post comments on this
entry. There are three options: <code>None</code>, <code>Open</code>, or <code>Closed</code>. If you select
<code>None</code>, visitors will not be able to post comments, nor will they be able
to view existing comments. If you select <code>Open</code>, visitors will be able to
both post and view existing comments. If you select <code>Closed</code>, visitors will
be able to view existing comments, but not post new comments. This is useful
when you wish to turn off commenting for an old post on your site, but you
wish to leave up the old comments for posterity.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Text_Formatting"></a>Text Formatting</strong><br>

Specifies the text formatting option for this entry. For example, the
<i>Convert Line Breaks</i> option encloses your paragraphs in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags, and converts line breaks to <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>
tags. You can select a different formatting option for each entry in the
system. The default for this entry is set in your weblog configuration under
<i>Default Text Formatting for new entries</i>.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Allow_Pings"></a>Allow Pings</strong><br>

Specifies whethere you would like to enable this entry to receive
<a href="./mtmanual_trackback.html">TrackBack</a> pings. This checkbox defines whether text
inside of a <code>MTEntryIfAllowPings</code> area will be displayed (see <a href="./mtmanual_tags.html#item_mtentryifallowpings">documentation for the tag</a>).
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_URLs_To_Ping"></a>URLs To Ping</strong><br>

A list of TrackBack URLs that you would like to ping for this entry. This is
for use when pinging a particular entry on a remote site--if you wish to
ping a remote site every time you place an entry in a certain category,
associate the <code>URL(s)</code> with that particular category. See
<a href="./mtmanual_categories.html">Categories</a> for more details.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Previous_Pings_Sent"></a>Previous Pings Sent</strong><br>

A list of TrackBack pings previously sent for this entry. This includes both
pings sent to remote entries <strong>and</strong> to remote categories (by associating a
category in your weblog with one or more ping URLs).
<p></p></ul>
<p>You can use the <code>PREVIEW</code> button to preview your entry before posting;
<code>CANCEL</code> will return you to the <i>List Entries</i> page.</p>
<p>After you have saved a new entry, you will be transferred directly into
editing mode for that entry. When editing an existing entry, you will have
several new options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Authored_On"></a>Authored On</strong><br>

Movable Type allows you to pre-date or post-date your entries by modifying the
<code>Authored on</code> date and time for an entry. If you change this value, you
<i>must</i> use the form <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</code>; otherwise you will get an error.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Assign_Multiple_Categories"></a>Assign Multiple Categories</strong><br>

The <a href="#item_Assign_Multiple_Categories"><code>Assign Multiple Categories</code></a> link opens a popup window that allows you
to manage the secondary categories to which your entry is assigned.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Delete"></a>Delete</strong><br>

You can delete an existing entry by pressing <code>DELETE ENTRY</code>; you will then be
asked to confirm that you really wish to delete the entry. Agree, and your
entry will be deleted.
<p></p></ul>
<p>Note that, upon saving an entry that is marked for <code>Publish</code>, your archives
for that entry, along with all of your indexes, are automatically rebuilt.
Thus you do not need to manually rebuild your files (see <i>REBUILDING FILES</i>,
below) after posting a new entry, or after editing an existing entry.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="entryediting shortcuts"></a>Entry-Editing Shortcuts</h2>
<p>If you are using Movable Type on Internet Explorer for Windows, you can make
use of a couple of keyboard shortcuts while editing your entries, to
automatically insert HTML formatting tags. To use these shortcuts, select the
text you wish to format in your entry, then press the appropriate keyboard
shortcut combination:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Bold_%2D_Ctrl%2DShift%2Db"></a>Bold - Ctrl-Shift-b</strong><br>

<li><strong><a name="item_Italic_%2D_Ctrl%2DShift%2Di"></a>Italic - Ctrl-Shift-i</strong><br>

<li><strong><a name="item_Underline_%2D_Ctrl%2DShift%2Du"></a>Underline - Ctrl-Shift-u</strong><br>

<li><strong><a name="item_Hyperlink_%2D_Ctrl%2DShift%2Da"></a>Hyperlink - Ctrl-Shift-a</strong><br>

</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="customizing the entry editing screen"></a>Customizing the Entry Editing Screen</h2>
<p>Movable Type allows you to customize the <i>New Entry</i> and <i>Edit Entry</i>
screens to fit with your usage of the system. This customization is done on
a per-author, per-weblog basis. In other words, as an author, you can have
different screen layouts for each weblog that you post to; and when you
customize the screens, your preferences will not trample over those of any
of the other authors in the system.</p>
<p>The system lets you choose between 2 predefined layouts (<i>Basic</i> and
<i>Advanced</i>), or allows you to create a custom layout, where you choose the
fields you would like displayed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Basic"></a>Basic</strong><br>

As the name implies, <i>Basic</i> is the simplest possible layout. It displays
editable fields for the entry title and entry body; a pulldown menu for the
Post Status; and an uneditable authored-on date.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Advanced"></a>Advanced</strong><br>

<i>Advanced</i> displays all of the custom fields available: entry title, entry
body, extended body, excerpt, Post Status, editable authored-on date,
category selection menu, <i>Allow Comments</i> options, and <i>Text Formatting</i>
options.
<p><i>Advanced</i> is the default layout.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Custom"></a>Custom</strong><br>

The <i>Custom</i> layout allows you the most flexibility; it allows you to choose
exactly which fields you would like to appear on the <i>New</i> and <i>Edit Entry</i>
screens. You can choose from any of the available fields listed above in
<i>Advanced</i>.
<p></p></ul>
<p>In addition to configuring the fields that you would like displayed, you can
also control the position of the button bar containing the <i>SAVE</i>,
<i>PREVIEW</i>, and <i>DELETE</i> buttons. The button bar can be displayed either at
the top of the page, above the entry-editing fields, or at the bottom, below
the entry-editing fields.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="powerediting mode"></a>Power-Editing Mode</h2>
<p>There are times when you might wish to make changes in batch to your entries;
for example, if you wish to change a number of entries from <code>Draft</code> status
to <code>Publish</code>, or if you wish to assign categories to entries you have
imported from another weblogging tool. In that case, you can use the Movable
Type's power-editing mode to edit multiple entries at once. Select the weblog
containing the entries you'd like to edit; then go to <code>List &amp; Edit Entries</code>;
then click <code>Open power-editing mode</code>.</p>
<p>The controls on the power-editing screen works just like the standard
<code>List &amp; Edit Entries</code> screen. You can filter the list of entries that you are
viewing by category, status, or author; and you can page through the entries
using the <code>PREVIOUS</code> and <code>NEXT</code> buttons at the bottom. On this screen, you
can edit the entry titles, categories, authored on dates, authors, and status
fields; after making the desired changes, save your entries by clicking
<code>SAVE</code>.</p>
