<p>Movable Type supports multiple languages through the use of language packs.
A language pack is simply a list of translated phrases and words, along with
a set of images for navigation within the Movable Type system.</p>
<p>To install a language pack that you've downloaded from the Movable Type
web site, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_Copy_the_translated_phrases%2E"></a>Copy the translated phrases.</strong><br>

The <i>.pm</i> file contains the plaintext list of translated phrases. Upload
this file into your <i>extlib/MT/L10N/</i> directory in ASCII mode. If you do
not have such a directory structure, create it.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Copy_the_images%2E"></a>Copy the images.</strong><br>

The folder named <i>lang-&lt;language_tag&gt;</i>, where &lt;language_tag&gt;&gt;
is the tag for the language you downloaded, contains the images needed by
the system. Upload this folder, in BINARY mode, into the <i>images</i> folder
that you uploaded when you installed Movable Type.
<p></p></ol>
<p>If you are interested in translating Movable Type into a language not
currently provided, please contact <i><a href="mailto:l10n@movabletype.org">l10n@movabletype.org</a></i>.</p>
