<h1><a name="about movable type"></a>ABOUT MOVABLE TYPE</h1>
<p>Movable Type (<i><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">http://www.movabletype.org/</a></i>) is a web-based personal
publishing system. It is designed to ease maintenance of regularly-updated
news or journal sites, like weblogs. It contains features common to many
other such systems (hosted locally on your server, template-driven,
highly-configurable, permalinks, etc.); in addition, it also includes support
for the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Import data -- allows you to import your entries and comments from other
content management systems (Blogger, Greymatter, News Pro), then manage those
posts through Movable Type.
<p></p>
<li>
Multiple output templates -- enables one-click publishing to multiple
destinations and formats: XML RSS headlines from your site, HTML indexes, etc.
<p></p>
<li>
Support for multiple weblogs/journals -- one Movable Type installation can
support as many weblogs as you wish.
<p></p>
<li>
Support for multiple authors -- register multiple authors, and set their
access levels using Movable Type's role-based permissions system.
<p></p>
<li>
Entry categorization -- group your entries into categories for your own
reference, for archiving purposes, and for display in your weblog.
<p></p>
<li>
Search and replace -- save time by performing a global search and replace on
all of your entries; use the search feature to look up a particular entry.
<p></p>
<li>
Multiple archiving options -- create monthly, weekly, and daily archives of
your content; individual pages for each entry; and archives by category.
Archive file names and URLs are fully customizable.
<p></p>
<li>
Built-in comment system -- allow your visitors to post comments on your
entries and engage in conversations. Movable Type supports comments either
inline in your weblog, or in popup windows; it also allows you to selectively
exclude commenting on certain posts.
<p></p>
<li>
Email notification system -- maintain lists of users to whom notification
messages can be sent when you post a new entry.
<p></p>
<li>
Integration of file and image uploads -- upload files and images, and
seamlessly integrate them into new posts.
<p></p>
<li>
Bookmarklets -- post to your site from anywhere on the web, without entering
the Movable Type system.
<p></p>
<li>
Template-based site customization -- combine Movable Type's template tags with
standard HTML (or whatever markup language you choose) to build and customize
your site.
<p></p>
<li>
Pre-date or post-date your entries -- Movable Type allows you to override an
entry's date stamp.
<p></p>
<li>
Delete entries -- Movable Type allows for true entry deletion, allowing you
to clean out old or unwanted entries.
<p></p>
<li>
Draft/Publish -- allow for content editorial and approval by setting
entries to <code>Draft</code>, then let an editor approve by marking <code>Publish</code>, at which
point the entries will be published on your site.
<p></p>
<li>
Publicity and notification -- send XML-RPC pings to weblogs.com and the
movabletype.org Recently Updated List.
<p></p>
<li>
XML-RPC API -- implements the Blogger XML-RPC API, allowing you to use
existing client tools (w.bloggar, BlogApp) to manage your weblog.
<p></p>
<li>
Extensible, library-driven code --if you have experience programming in Perl,
you can write custom dynamic applications using the Movable Type libraries.
