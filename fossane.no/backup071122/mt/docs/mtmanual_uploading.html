<h1><a name="uploading files"></a>UPLOADING FILES</h1>
<p>Movable Type offers an interface for uploading files--either images or
regular files--onto your webserver for use on your site. You can upload files
into either your <code>Local Site Path</code> or your <code>Local Archive Path</code> directories;
in addition, you can upload files into any directory beneath those two
directories.</p>
<p>To upload a file, log in to Movable Type, select your weblog, then click
<code>Upload File</code>. Browse your hard drive to choose the file you wish to upload.
Then choose where you would like to upload the to. For example, if you are
uploading an image, and you typically keep all of your images in an <i>images</i>
directory under your <code>Local Site Path</code>, you should click the <code>Local Site
Path</code> radio button, then enter <code>images</code> into the text box next to it. After
choosing a destination for the uploaded file, click <code>UPLOAD</code>.</p>
<p>If a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory, you
will have the option of overwriting the existing file; if you choose not to
overwrite the existing file, the file you uploaded will be deleted, and you
can then rename the file locally and upload it again, or resolve the issue in
some other manner. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> if you do not receive the option to overwrite the
existing file, but instead receive an error about <i>File::Temp</i> not being
installed, take a look at the Installation Instructions, in the section
<code>If you need to install File::Temp</code>.)</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="autocreating a new entry"></a>Auto-Creating a New Entry</h2>
<p>After you have uploaded a file, you have the choice of either creating a
new entry using that uploaded file, or just displaying the HTML used to link
to the file. For example, if you have uploaded an image, and would like to
create a new entry with a link to that image in a popup window, select
<code>Create a new entry using this uploaded file</code>, and press <code>POPUP IMAGE</code>. If
you are already editing an entry, then you won't want to create another new
entry (and perhaps lose the one that you are working on); so in that case,
click the <code>Show me the HTML</code> button and click <code>POPUP IMAGE</code>. This will
display the HTML code for opening the image in a popup window. You can then
copy and paste this code into the entry you are editing.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="creating thumbnails"></a>Creating Thumbnails</h2>
<p>If you uploaded an image, and if your server has the <i>Image::Magick</i> Perl
module installed, you have the additional option of creating a thumbnail of
the image that you uploaded. To create a thumbnail, check the <code>Create a
thumbnail for this image</code>, then adjust the <code>Width</code> and <code>Height</code> boxes to
scale the image to the size or percentage that you want. You can scale either
by pixel size (<code>Pixels</code> in the pull-down menu), or by percentage (<code>Percent</code>
in the pull-down menu).</p>
<p>In addition, you can scale width and height either in proportion to their
original sizes, or out of proportion (to distort the image). By default, the
<code>Constrain proportions</code> box is checked; this will ensure that if you make a
change to either the width or height, the other dimension will be scaled
appropriately. If you uncheck the <code>Constrain proportions</code> checkbox, you will
be able to scale the width and height to different proportions.</p>
<p>When creating a thumbnail, the <code>POPUP IMAGE</code> button will generate HTML to
display your thumbnail image as a link to a popup window containing the
full-size image that you uploaded. The <code>EMBEDDED IMAGE</code> button will generate
HTML to display your thumbnail image as a link to the full-size image in the
same window.</p>
