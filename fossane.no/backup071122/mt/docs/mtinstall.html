<hr size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
<h1><a name="synopsis"></a>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>This document describes the process of installing the Movable Type system
on your machine.</p>
<p>
<hr size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
<h1><a name="requirements"></a>REQUIREMENTS</h1>
<p>Movable Type requires the following:</p>
<a name="require"></a><ul>
<li>
An account on a webserver that allows you to run custom CGI scripts. If you're
not sure whether yours does, your hosting provider should know. The
application itself is around 2 megabytes, but we suggest that you have at least
25 megabytes of disk space available on your server to accommodate future
files and posts.
<p></p>
<li>
Perl installed on your server, version 5.004_04 or greater. <a href="#version of perl on your server">Don't know what version of Perl you have?</a>
<p></p>
<li>
An FTP program to upload the necessary files to your webserver, or shell
access if you wish to install the system from the shell.
<p></p>
<li>
A web browser with Javascript enabled.
<p></p></ul>
<p>

<h1><a name="installing movable type"></a>INSTALLING MOVABLE TYPE</h1>
<p>
<h2><a name="downloading"></a>Downloading</h2>
<p>The distribution can be downloaded from the Movable Type web site at
<i><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/download.shtml">http://www.movabletype.org/download.shtml</a></i>.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the Movable Type distribution available for
download: one is bundled with all of the external libraries that you will
need to run the system, whereas the other contains just the Movable Type
system itself. If you know that your hosting provider has all of the
modules already installed, download the ``lite'' version without the external
libraries. Otherwise, the ``full'' version with external libraries included
will make installation easier, because you will not have to worry about
installing external libraries.</p>
<p>After downloading, the file that you downloaded is saved in <i>.tar.gz</i> format;
this is a compressed bundle containing the files in the Movable Type
distribution. Unpack this archive.</p>
<p>(<a href="#unpacking .tar.gz archives">Need help unpacking archives?</a>).</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="finding perl on your server"></a>Finding Perl on your Server</h2>
<p>The following files are Perl scripts: <i>mt-add-notify.cgi</i>, <i>mt-check.cgi</i>,
<i>mt-comments.cgi</i>, <i>mt-load.cgi</i>, <i>mt-send-entry.cgi</i>, <i>mt-tb.cgi</i>,
<i>mt-search.cgi</i>, <i>mt.cgi</i>, <i>mt-xmlrpc.cgi</i>, and <i>mt-view.cgi</i>.
The first line of each of these files must contain the path to Perl on your
webserver; typically this is <i>#!/usr/bin/perl</i>. You may need to change this
if Perl is at a different location on your webserver, such as
<i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i>. If you do need to change the setting, take care not to
remove the <code>-w</code> at the end of the first line in each file; this setting turns
on warnings in Perl, and it is important that it be left on.</p>
<p>To determine the location of Perl on your webserver, take a look at the
support pages for your hosting service. Alternatively, if you have a shell
(command line) account, and are familiar using it, you can log in to that
account that type:</p>
<pre>$ whereis perl
</pre><p>This will give you the <code>location(s)</code> of Perl on your system.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> despite its extension, <i>mt-db-pass.cgi</i> is not a normal Perl script,
so it should not contain the path to Perl.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="installation directories"></a>Installation Directories</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_The_application"></a><strong>The application</strong></strong><br>

Choose where on your webserver you would like to install Movable Type. This
is the location that you will use (from your web browser) when using the
Movable Type system.
<p><i>If you will be installing Movable Type into your <i>cgi-bin</i>
directory</i>, note that you will need to upload your static files--<i>images</i>,
<i>docs</i>, and <i>styles.css</i>--into a directory <strong>outside</strong> of the <i>cgi-bin</i>.
Static files cannot be left inside the <i>cgi-bin</i>, because the web server
will try to execute them, rendering them unusable through the web interface.</p>
<p>A solution is to create a new directory in your web-accessible area called
<i>mt-static</i>, then upload <i>images</i>, <i>docs</i>, and <i>styles.css</i> into that
directory. Note the URL corresponding to <i>mt-static</i>, because you will need
to use it later when configuring the system in your <i>mt.cfg</i> file.</p>
<a name="install_cgiwrap"></a><p><strong>TIP:</strong> You can make your Movable Type installation more secure if you run
the system under <i>cgiwrap</i> or <i>suexec</i>. See these
<a href="#using cgiwrap or suexec">tips on using cgiwrap or suexec</a> to find out if
you have either of these tools.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_The_database"></a><strong>The database</strong></strong><br>

<i>If you plan to use Movable Type's MySQL or PostgreSQL database support:</i>
<p>These require no external directories to be created.</p>
<p><i>If you plan to use Movable Type's Berkeley DB support (the default):</i></p>
<p>Choose where on your webserver you would like to store your Movable Type
database files.</p>
<p><i>If you are not installing into a <i>cgi-bin</i> directory</i>, it is advisable
from a security standpoint to create the database
directory outside of your web-accessible directories. This prevents web
browsers from seeing any of your database content. For example, many hosted
accounts have a home directory that is not web-accessible, then a
<i>public_html</i> directory that is the root of your web-accessible area.
Placing the database outside of the web-accessible area prevents web browsers
from seeing your database content; placing it in the <i>cgi-bin</i> directory
has the same effect.</p>
<p><i>If you plan to use Movable Type's SQLite database support:</i></p>
<p>SQLite stores your data in a single database file. However, it needs to be
able to create that file itself, so you must store that file in a 
world-writable directory. Thus, you should follow the
guidelines above regarding Berkeley DB support for the location of the SQLite
database directory.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Your_weblog_directories"></a><strong>Your weblog directories</strong></strong><br>

You need to set up a directory where your weblog will be stored. This is the
location that visitors to your web site will come to to read your weblog.
You can also choose to store your weblog archives in a separate directory
than your main weblog, if you wish.
<p></p></ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_Open_mt%2Ecfg"></a><strong>Open mt.cfg</strong></strong><br>

Find the file <i>mt.cfg</i> in the Movable Type folder that you downloaded, then
open that file in a text editor.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Configure_Movable_Type_URL%2E"></a><strong>Configure Movable Type URL.</strong></strong><br>

Change the line starting
with <i>CGIPath</i> to point to the URL where you chose to install Movable Type
in <i>Installation Directories</i>.
<p>For example, if you are installing Movable Type at
<i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/movabletype/">http://www.your-site.com/movabletype/</a></i>, you would change the <i>CGIPath</i>
line to</p>
<pre>CGIPath http://www.your-site.com/movabletype/
</pre><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> make sure that your URL contains a forward slash (<code>/</code>) at the end!</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_options"></a><strong>Configure Database options (for MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).</strong></strong><br>

<i>If you are not using Movable Type's SQL database support, skip this step.</i>
<p>In the text editor where you are editing <i>mt.cfg</i>, add these lines:</p>
<pre>ObjectDriver driver_name
Database database_name
DBUser database_user
</pre><p>where: <i>driver_name</i> is one of the following: <i>DBI::mysql</i>, <i>DBI::postgres</i>,
or <i>DBI::sqlite</i>; <i>database_name</i> is the name of the SQL database where
you wish to store your data, and <i>database_user</i> is the username used to
connect to the database</p>
<p>If your SQL database server is on a different host, you can use <i>DBHost</i>
to specify the hostname:</p>
<pre>DBHost database_host
</pre><p>If your SQL database server is on the localhost, but the socket is not in a
standard location, you can set the path to the socket using <i>DBSocket</i>:</p>
<pre>DBSocket /path/to/mysql.sock
</pre><p>If your SQL database server is on a different port than the default, you
can set the port using <i>DBPort</i>:</p>
<pre>DBPort port_number
</pre><p><i>Note:</i> if you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL, the database that you specify
<strong>must</strong> already exist--Movable Type cannot create it automatically!</p>
<p><i>Note</i>: if you are using SQLite, no username is required, and
<i>database_name</i> is the name of the database file. You can name the database
file whatever you want--<i>mtdb</i> would be a good choice. Remember to include
the name of the directory where you are storing the database file in the
<i>database_name</i>. For example:</p>
<pre>Database db/mtdb
</pre><p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_directory"></a><strong>Configure path to Database directory (for Berkeley DB).</strong></strong><br>

<i>If you are not using Movable Type's Berkeley DB support, skip this step.</i>
<p>In the text editor where you are editing <i>mt.cfg</i>, change the line</p>
<pre>DataSource ./db
</pre><p>to instead read</p>
<pre>DataSource /FULL/PATH/TO/DB
</pre><p>where <i>/FULL/PATH/TO/DB</i> is replaced by the full filesystem path to the <i>db</i>
directory you just created. For example, if you create the directory at
<i>/home/melody/db</i>, the above line would read</p>
<pre>DataSource /home/melody/db
</pre><p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Configure_path_to_Static_files%2E"></a><strong>Configure path to Static files.</strong></strong><br>

<i>If you are not installing into the <i>cgi-bin</i>, skip this step.</i>
<p>You need to set the <i>StaticWebPath</i> value in your <i>mt.cfg</i> file to the
URL corresponding to the directory that you chose for your static files
(<i>images</i>, <i>docs</i>, and <i>styles.css</i>). For example, if you chose to
locate your static files at the root of your web-accessible area, you would
add this line to <i>mt.cfg</i>:</p>
<pre>StaticWebPath /mt-static/
</pre><p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Enable_security_features%2E"></a><strong>Enable security features.</strong></strong><br>

<i>If your server does not have <i>cgiwrap</i> or <i>suexec</i>, skip this step.</i>
<p>To enable the heightened security that cgiwrap and suexec provide, add the
following lines to your <i>mt.cfg</i> file:</p>
<pre>DBUmask 0022
HTMLUmask 0022
UploadUmask 0022
DirUmask 0022
</pre><p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Save_and_exit_mt%2Ecfg%2E"></a><strong>Save and exit mt.cfg.</strong></strong><br>

Then save the <i>mt.cfg</i> file, and exit the text editor.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Set_your_SQL_database_password%2E"></a><strong>Set your SQL database password.</strong></strong><br>

<i>If you are not using MySQL or PostgreSQL, skip this step.</i>
<p>For security purposes, your SQL database password should not simply be placed
in <i>mt.cfg</i>. Instead, you must set it in the file called <i>mt-db-pass.cgi</i>.</p>
<p>Open <i>mt-db-pass.cgi</i> in a text editor. On this line:</p>
<pre>database_password
</pre><p>Replace <i>database_password</i> with the password used to connect to your
SQL database.</p>
<p>Then save the <i>mt-db-pass.cgi</i> file, and exit the text editor.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>
<h2><a name="uploading files"></a>Uploading Files</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_Connect_to_your_webserver"></a>Connect to your webserver</strong><br>

Open your FTP program and open an FTP connection to your web server.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Upload_the_application"></a>Upload the application</strong><br>

In your FTP program, if the directory where you chose to install Movable Type
does not exist, create it. Then open that directory.
<p>Upload all of the files in the Movable Type distribution to your webserver.</p>
<p><i>If you are installing into the <i>cgi-bin</i>:</i> you should upload <i>images</i>,
<i>docs</i>, and <i>styles.css</i> into the location you chose for your static
files.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> be careful when doing this, as certain files must be uploaded in ASCII
mode, whereas others must be uploaded in binary mode. If you get it wrong, the
scripts <strong>WILL NOT WORK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Upload these files/folders in ASCII mode:</strong> <i>docs</i>, <i>lib</i>, <i>extlib</i>,
<i>mt.cfg</i>, <i>styles.css</i>, <i>tmpl</i>, <i>schemas</i>, <i>search_templates</i>,
<i>plugins</i>, and all of the CGI scripts (<i>mt.cgi</i>, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Upload these files/folders in Binary mode:</strong> <i>images</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Set_permissions"></a>Set permissions</strong><br>

Set the permissions of all of the CGI scripts (files whose names end in
<i>.cgi</i>) to 755.
<p>Permissions set to 755 means that all users on the system have <code>Read</code> and
<code>Execute</code> permissions; only the owner should have <code>Write</code> permissions.</p>
<p>If your FTP client uses a graphical display for setting permissions, that
display will look something like this:<br><br>
<img src="755.gif" width="297" height="210"></p><p>If you are setting permissions through a Unix shell, simply use the command</p>
<pre>$ chmod 755 mt*.cgi
</pre><p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Create_your_Movable_Type_database_directory"></a>Create your Movable Type database directory</strong><br>

<i>If you are not using Berkeley DB or SQLite, skip this step.</i>
<p>Open the directory you chose for the location of your Movable Type database.</p>
<a name="setperms_db"></a><p>Create a new directory called <i>db</i>.</p>
<p>If you are not running Movable Type under <i>cgiwrap</i> or <i>suexec</i>, set the
permissions (CHMOD) of this directory <i>db</i> to 777.</p>
<p>Permissions set to 777 means that all users on the system have <code>Read</code>,
<code>Write</code>, and <code>Execute</code> permissions.</p>
<p>If your FTP client uses a graphical display for setting permissions, that
display will look something like this:<br><br>
<img src="777.gif" width="297" height="210"></p><p>If you are setting permissions through a Unix shell, simply use the command</p>
<pre>$ chmod 777 db
</pre><p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Create_your_weblog_directories"></a>Create your weblog directories</strong><br>

Create the directory where you weblog files will be stored. This is the
directory that you chose for the location of your weblog directories.
<p>If you are not running Movable Type under <i>cgiwrap</i> or <i>suexec</i>, set the
permissions of the directories you just created to 777 (see above for what
this means).</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>
<h2><a name="checking for perl modules"></a>Checking for Perl Modules</h2>
<p>Movable Type requires the presence of several standard Perl modules, separate
from the Movable Type code itself. If you downloaded the ``full'' version of
the Movable Type distribution, it came with all of the necessary modules,
except for <i>DB_File</i>, <i>DBD::mysql</i>, and <i>Image::Magick</i> (these modules
can not be distributed with Movable Type because they require compilation).
To determine whether these modules are installed on your
server--and to install them, if they are not already installed--follow the
steps below.</p>
<p>For the function of several optional features, Movable Type needs some optional
Perl modules. These optional modules will be listed in Step 1 (below) under
the heading <code>CHECKING FOR OPTIONAL MODULES</code>; if your webserver does not have
an optional module, its purpose will be explained in relation to the Movable
Type feature for which it is required. If you decide that you want to use these
features, you will need to install these modules, as well; however, if you do
not wish to use these features, you can ignore the missing modules.</p>
<p>Open your web browser and point it at the URL for <i>mt-check.cgi</i> on your
site. For example, if your site is <i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/">http://www.your-site.com/</a></i>, and you
uploaded the Movable Type files into the <i>/mt</i> directory, you'd type
<i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt-check.cgi">http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt-check.cgi</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>mt-check.cgi</i> is a Perl script that checks whether the required modules are
installed on your server. If you get a 500 Internal Server Error when running
this script, first check that you set the permissions to 755 (see above for
what this means), and that you uploaded the file in ASCII mode. If these
suggestions don't help, refer to <a href="./mtmanual_troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
<p>If the script runs successfully, it will say <code>CHECKING FOR REQUIRED MODULES</code>
and so on. If the script reports that your server has all of the required
modules installed, you can skip to <a href="#initializing the system">Initializing the System</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to install any required modules, or if you wish to require some
of the optional modules, install them now, using the following instructions:</p>

</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="initializing the system"></a>Initializing the System</h2>
<p>Open your web browser and point it at the URL for <i>mt-load.cgi</i> on your
site. For example, if your site is <i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/">http://www.your-site.com/</a></i>, and you
uploaded the Movable Type files into the <i>/mt</i> directory, you'd type
<i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt-load.cgi">http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt-load.cgi</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>mt-load.cgi</i> is a Perl script that loads initialization data into the
Movable Type databases: an initial author, a weblog, and some starter templates.
If you get a 500 Internal Server Error when running this script, first check
that you set the permissions to 755 (see above for what this means), and that
you uploaded the file in ASCII mode. If these suggestions don't help, refer
to <a href="./mtmanual_troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
<p>If successful, <i>mt-load.cgi</i> will report its success. If unsuccessful, it
will report the error that occurred; look in <a href="./mtmanual_troubleshooting.html#errors when running mtload.cgi">Troubleshooting</a> for instructions on how to fix the
error.</p>
<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>Afer running <i>mt-load.cgi</i> successfully, you should remove <i>mt-load.cgi</i> from
the directory where you installed Movable Type. Failure to remove <i>mt-load.cgi</i>
could enable someone else to create a weblog in your Movable Type installation,
and possibly gain access to your data. FAILURE TO DELETE <i>mt-load.cgi</i>
INTRODUCES A MAJOR SECURITY RISK. So you should delete it now.</p>
<p>
<hr size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
<h1><a name="running movable type"></a>RUNNING MOVABLE TYPE</h1>
<p>Now that you have installed the system, you are ready to start using it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open your web browser and point it at the URL for <i>mt.cgi</i> on your site.
<i>mt.cgi</i> is the main Movable Type application. For example, if your site is
<i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/">http://www.your-site.com/</a></i>, and you installed the Movable Type application
into the <i>/mt</i> directory, you'd type <i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt.cgi">http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt.cgi</a></i>
to access Movable Type.
<p>You should see the Movable Type login prompt. If you do not, check your
permissions, and check that you uploaded the CGI scripts using ASCII mode.
If neither of these helps, take a look at
<a href="./mtmanual_troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
Log in with the author name <code>Melody</code> and the password <code>Nelson</code>.
<p></p>
<li>
The first thing you should do is change your author name and password. To
do so, click <code>Edit your profile</code>, then change the author name and password
there.
<p></p>
<li>
The next thing to do is to configure your first weblog. A weblog called <code>First
Weblog</code> already exists in the system; this weblog will help to give you a head
start in setting up your first weblog in Movable Type. <code>First Weblog</code> comes
with some pre-made templates; of course you can edit these templates, or delete
them, or do whatever you like with them. But they are a good starting point,
and will give you a sense of familiarity with the Movable Type template tags
and structure.
<p>To configure the weblog for your own purposes, click on the link to <code>First
Weblog</code> under <code>Your existing weblogs</code>, then click on the link to <code>Weblog
Config</code>. Change the name of the weblog to whatever you wish to call
your weblog, and enter a description.</p>
<p>Then, fill in the path and URL information (<code>Local Site Path</code>, <code>Site URL</code>,
<code>Local Archive Path</code>, and <code>Archive URL</code>). Values for <code>Local Site Path</code> and
<code>Site URL</code> are provided by default, to give you a sense of what the paths
should look like; when setting the values of <code>Local Site Path</code> and <code>Local
Archive Path</code>, it is best to use absolute paths (paths beginning with a <code>/</code>),
rather than relative paths. Note that <i>all four</i> of these fields <i>must</i> be
filled in. You should already have created the directories for your weblog
(above, in <i>Create your weblog directories</i>). Fill in the local paths
(site and archive) with the full paths to those directories. Then enter the
appropriate URLs, corresponding to those directories.</p>
<p>Edit any other configuration settings for your weblog; when you are done,
press <code>SAVE</code>.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
That's it! You're now ready to start posting entries to your weblog, editing
templates, and so on.

<h2><a name="if you need to install db_file"></a>If you need to install DB_File</h2>
<p>If you are installing Movable Type on a
Win32 machine on which you have administrative access, you can run the Perl
Package Manager (PPM) to install DB_File. Select <code>Run...</code> from the Start
Menu, then type <code>ppm</code> as the program to run. Once in PPM, you will get a
prompt (<code>ppm&gt;</code>), at which you should type <code>install DB_File</code>:</p>
<pre>ppm&gt; install DB_File
</pre><p>If you are installing Movable Type on a Linux/Unix machine, you should ask
your server administrator to install DB_File for you. If you are the
administrator, you will first need to install the Berkeley DB libraries
(download from <i><a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">http://www.sleepycat.com/</a></i>), then install the DB_File
Perl module (download from <i><a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a></i>).</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="if you need to install dbd::mysql, dbd::pg, or dbd::sqlite"></a>If you need to install DBD::mysql, DBD::Pg, or DBD::SQLite</h2>
<p>If your server does not have the required DBD module, you should first consider
using Movable Type's Berkeley DB support (the default).</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will need to contact your hosting provider and ask them to
install the <i>DBI</i> module and whichever of the above modules is necessary to
connect to your database. Note that your account will
need access to a SQL database, apart from the existence of these modules,
in order for you to use Movable Type's SQL database support.</p>

<h2><a name="if you need to install image::magick"></a>If you need to install Image::Magick</h2>
<p>Installing <i>Image::Magick</i> requires compilation of the ImageMagick library,
as well as installation of the Perl module that talks to this library. If you
wish to have this module installed on your server, you will need to ask your
system administrator to install it for you. Note that if you do not have
<i>Image::Magick</i>, Movable Type will still work without a hitch--installation
of <i>Image::Magick</i> is optional, and is needed only for creating thumbnails of
uploaded images.</p>

<p>
<h2><a name="problems with f2s"></a>Problems with f2s</h2>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> problems have been reported when running Movable Type on f2s
accounts. These problems have been disk-space-related; specifically, if your
f2s account is low on disk space, you should be careful when running Movable
Type, because running out of disk space while the database is being updated
could corrupt your data. This error is almost always fixable, but it is
certainly an annoyance. Note that this problem is not necessarily unique to
either Movable Type or f2s; when applications run out of disk space while
trying to update files, problems will often occur.</p>

<h2><a name="version of perl on your server"></a>Version of Perl on your server</h2>
<p>If you're not sure what version of Perl you have on your server, you can
figure it out in one of three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Check the support documentation that your ISP (probably) provides.
<p></p>
<li>
Ask your ISP.
<p></p>
<li>
If you have shell access to your webserver, you can telnet into your server,
then run the following command:
<pre>$ perl -v
</pre><p>This command will print out the version of Perl on your webserver.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p><a href="#require">Back to installation instructions</a></p><p>
<h2><a name="unpacking .tar.gz archives"></a>Unpacking .tar.gz Archives</h2>
<p>Movable Type distributions, as well as the distributions for most of the
required and optional Perl modules, are saved in <i>.tar.gz</i> format--these are
Gzip-ed TAR archives. If you are on Unix, you can use <i>gunzip</i> and <i>tar</i> to
unpack these archives. For example:</p>
<pre>$ gunzip file.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf file.tar
</pre><p>If you are on a Macintosh, Stuffit Expander will unpack these archives. If
you are on Windows, PKZip or Winzip (in classic mode) will do the job.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if, after unzipping the Movable Type distribution archive, you find
a folder without a directory structure--that is, a lot of files dumped into
one folder, rather than grouped into sub-folders--then you will have trouble
installing Movable Type. This problem usually signifies that you used Winzip's
wizard mode to unzip the archives; if this is the case, make sure that you use
Winzip in classic mode, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="using cgiwrap or suexec"></a>Using cgiwrap or suexec</h2>
<p><i>cgiwrap</i> and <i>suexec</i> are special tools on the webserver that allow your CGI
scripts to be executed as ``you'', rather than as the webserver. This simplifies
Movable Type installation, because you no longer have to set permissions on
your weblog or <i>db</i> directories (though you still need to set the permissions
on the CGI scripts themselves); it is also more secure, because your weblog
directories will be writeable only by you.</p>
<p>You may need to check with your hosting provider to determine if your server
has cgiwrap or suexec installed. Movable Type can make a guess as to whether
it is supported, however. When you run <i>mt-check.cgi</i>, under the line
reporting the version of Perl on your server, look for a line that says</p>
<pre>(Probably) running under cgiwrap or suexec
</pre><p>This indicates that your server probably has <i>cgiwrap</i> or <i>suexec</i>
installed.</p>
<p><a href="#install_cgiwrap">Back to installation instructions</a></p><p>
<h2><a name="win32 configuration tips"></a>Win32 Configuration Tips</h2>
<p>When configuring Movable Type for use on a Win32 server, you should keep in
mind the following tip:</p>
<ol>
<li>
When specifying full filesystem paths--for example, for the <i>DataSource</i>
setting--some servers will require that you insert the drive letter at the
front, and that you use backslashes. For example:
<pre>DataSource d:\full\path\to\db
</pre><p></p></ol>
<p>
<h2><a name="protecting mt.cfg"></a>Protecting mt.cfg</h2>
<p>If you are not running Movable Type out of a <i>cgi-bin</i> directory, you may
want to think about protecting your <i>mt.cfg</i> file by adding the following
to an <i>.htaccess</i> file in the directory where you installed MT:</p>
<pre>&lt;Files mt.cfg&gt;
    &lt;Limit GET&gt;
    deny from all
    &lt;/Limit&gt;
&lt;/Files&gt;
