<p>At times, after posting a new entry, you may wish to send email to your
readers, to inform them of the new entry. Movable Type makes this easy with
its notification system. You can use the <i>mt-add-notify.cgi</i> program to
provide a simple ``Notify me when new posts are added'' button, thus
automating the process of adding users to your notification list. You can
manage this list--either add a new address to your notification list, or
delete addresses from that list--in the <i>Edit Notifications</i> section of
Movable Type.</p>
<p>Notifications are never sent automatically when you post a new entry. To send
a notification to your readers on a particular entry, select that entry for
editing. In the <i>Send a notification</i> section, enter the text of the message
you would like to send. You can also include the excerpt from your entry, or
the entire body of your entry, by checking either of the checkboxes to the
right. The message sent to your readers will include a link to the entry,
followed by the message that you enter.</p>
<p>Movable Type comes with a simple CGI script designed to let visitors to your
site add themselves to your notification list. You can use an HTML form to
let visitors enter their email addresses, then submit, which will add them
to the notification list. To use this script, insert this HTML code into one
of your templates, where you would like the form to appear:</p>
<pre>&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&lt;$MTCGIPath$&gt;mt-add-notify.cgi&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;blog_id&quot; value=&quot;&lt;$MTBlogID$&gt;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;_redirect&quot; value=&quot;&lt;$MTBlogURL$&gt;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;input name=&quot;email&quot; size=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;add&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre><p>Then save the template and rebuild your site.</p>
