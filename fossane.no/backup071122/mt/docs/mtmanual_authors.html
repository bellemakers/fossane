<p>Each weblog in the Movable Type system can have multiple authors assigned to
it, with varying levels of access. Movable Type uses a role-based
authorization system, meaning that you assign access to authors by enabling
or disabling them from performing certain ``roles'', or actions. For example,
you might have one author who you trust completely; you could assign this
author full permissions, to post to your weblog, edit templates, edit author
permissions, edit categories, etc. You might have another author who you
do not trust quite as well; you could only allow this user to post entries
(and edit his own posts that he has made in the past).</p>
<p>To edit the permissions of an existing author, login to Movable Type, then
click <i>Add or Edit Weblog Authors</i>. Select the author name from the pulldown
menu, then click <code>EDIT</code>. On this screen you can assign permissions on any
weblog for which you have author-editing permissions. You can add an author to
one of your weblogs by selecting that weblog from the pulldown menu at the
bottom, then clicking <code>add</code>.</p>
<p>You can edit your own authoring permissions by selecting your own name from
the pulldown menu. Be careful when doing this, however, particularly with
respect to turning off author-editing permissions for yourself. If you turn
off your author-editing permissions, you will be unable to turn them back on.</p>
<p>To add a new author to the system, login to Movable Type, then click <i>Add
or Edit Weblog Authors</i>. In the <i>Add an author</i> section, enter the new
author's username, email address, and website URL; then enter a password for
the author. You can assign authoring privileges to the new author by
selecting from the weblogs listed at right, and checking the appropriate boxes.</p>
