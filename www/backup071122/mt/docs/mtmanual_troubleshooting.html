<p>
<h2><a name="i see the source of the cgi script when i run movable type"></a>I see the source of the CGI script when I run Movable Type</h2>
<p>If, when you try to load <i>mt.cgi</i> into your browser--or <i>mt-load.cgi</i> or
<i>mt-check.cgi</i> during the installation process--then the problem is that
your webserver does not have CGI scripting enabled in its configuration.</p>
<p>If you run your web site on a hosted provider, you will need to email the
support for this provider and ask them to turn on CGI scripting for your
account (or for the webserver on a whole); this is not something that you can
configure yourself.</p>
<p>If you run your own webserver, or if you have access to the webserver
configuration files--and the privileges to restart the webserver, after
modifying the configuration--you can use these steps to enable CGI scripts on
your webserver. The following instructions assume that you are running Apache.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Find the configuration file <i>httpd.conf</i>, and open it up in an editor.
<p></p>
<li>
Find the <code>Directory</code> or <code>Location</code> block that configures the webroot for
the server.
<p>Inside of that block, add this line:</p>
<pre>Options +ExecCGI
</pre><p></p>
<li>
Outside of the <code>Directory</code> or <code>Location</code> block, add the line
<pre>AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
</pre><p></p>
<li>
Restart the webserver.
<p></p></ol>
<p>CGI scripts should now execute, instead of merely displaying their source.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="i get a 500 internal server error"></a>I get a 500 Internal Server Error</h2>
<p><code>500 Internal Server Error</code> is the general webserver error that occurs when
something goes wrong--in particular, when something goes wrong when trying to
execute a CGI script.</p>
<p>Here is a list of diagnostics for trying to fix this error:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Are all of the CGI scripts and libraries uploaded in ASCII mode?
<p></p>
<li>
Have you set the permissions properly for all of the CGI scripts? They should
all be set to 755; this grants read/write/execute permissions to the owner,
and read/execute permissions to everyone else.
<p></p>
<li>
Check that the path to Perl is correct for your machine. The path to Perl
is specified on the first line of each CGI script, like this:
<i>#!/path/to/perl</i>, where <i>/path/to/perl</i> is the path. Typically on a Unix
server this is <i>#!/usr/bin/perl</i>. You may need to change this value in each
CGI script if the path is different on your webserver. If you do need to
change the setting, take care not to remove the <code>-w</code> at the end of the first
line in each file; this setting turns on warnings in Perl, and it is important
that it be left on.
<p>To determine the location of Perl on your webserver,  take a look at the
support pages for your hosting service. Alternatively, if you have a shell
(command line) account, and are familiar using it, you can log in to that
account that type:</p>
<pre>$ whereis perl
</pre><p>This will give you the <code>location(s)</code> of Perl on your system.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
Does your webserver have a sufficiently high version of Perl? Movable Type
requires Perl version 5.004_04 or greater, and errors will occur when trying
to use a version of Perl earlier than this.
<p></p></ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="errors when running mtload.cgi"></a>Errors when running mt-load.cgi</h2>
<p>When running <i>mt-load.cgi</i>, if you get an error that says
<code>Tie '/path/to/db' failed: No such file or directory</code> or
<code>Tie '/path/to/db' failed: Permission denied</code>, this indicates that the
<i>DataSource</i> path that you have set in <i>mt.cfg</i> is incorrect, or that the
permissions on your <i>db</i> directory are incorrect.</p>
<p>The <i>DataSource</i> setting should contain the full filesystem path to your
<i>db</i> directory. You can obtain this path in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you have shell access to your server (through either telnet or SSH), you
can use command line tools to determine the full path to your <i>db</i>
directory. After logging in to your home directory, use the <i>cd</i> command to
open your <i>db</i> directory:
<pre>$ cd my/db/
</pre><p>where <i>my/db/</i> is the path to your <i>db</i> directory from your home directory.
Then use the <i>pwd</i> directory to display the full path to that directory:</p>
<pre>$ pwd
</pre><p>This will print out the full path, which you can then copy and paste into
your <i>mt.cfg</i> file as the <i>DataSource</i> value.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
If you do not have shell access, you can get a sense of the path to your
<i>db</i> directory by running <i>mt-check.cgi</i>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> this will not tell you
<i>exact</i> path to your <i>db</i> directory; rather, it is intended to show you the
full path to your home directory, from which you should be able to figure out
the rest of the path.
<p>To use this method, run <i>mt-check.cgi</i> by pointing your browser at the
URL for <i>mt-check.cgi</i> on your site. For example, if your site is
<i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/">http://www.your-site.com/</a></i>, and you uploaded the Movable Type files into
the <i>/mt</i> directory, you'd type <i><a href="http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt-check.cgi">http://www.your-site.com/mt/mt-check.cgi</a></i>.</p>
<p>In the output of <i>mt-check.cgi</i>, look for a line like this:</p>
<pre>Current working directory: /path/to/your/mt/directory
</pre><p>This is the full path to the directory where you installed Movable Type. From
that path, you should be able to determine the full path to your <i>db</i>
directory.</p>
<p></p></ul>
<p>If you are getting a <code>Permission denied</code> error, this may indicate that the
permissions on your <i>db</i> directory are incorrect. The installation
instructions describe <a href="./mtinstall.html#setting 777 permissions">how to set permissions to 777</a>.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="can't load error template"></a>``Can't load error template''</h2>
<p>When first trying to view the Movable Type application using the <i>mt.cgi</i>
program, if you receive a long error that starts <code>Can't load error
template, got error 'Loading template 'error.tmpl' failed</code> and continues from
there, this indicates that Movable Type can't find the files in your <i>tmpl</i>
directory.</p>
<p>If this happens, try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
First check to ensure that the directory <i>tmpl</i> is in the same directory as
<i>mt.cgi</i>; that inside <i>tmpl</i> there is a directory called <i>cms</i>; and that
inside <i>cms</i> there are a number of files with the extension <i>.tmpl</i>.
<p>In addition, make sure that the case on the directories is correct; they
<strong>are</strong> case sensitive, so if your FTP program changes the name of the
directory to <i>Cms</i>, for example, this will not work.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
If all of the files are in the location they should be, the issue may be that
your webserver runs CGI scripts with a different current working directory
than the directory in which the CGI scripts actually live.
<p>To fix this, open your <i>mt.cfg</i> file in a text editor, and add the following
line:</p>
<pre>TemplatePath /full/path/to/tmpl/
</pre><p>where <i>/full/path/to/tmpl/</i> is the full path to your <i>tmpl</i> directory.</p>
<p>Save <i>mt.cfg</i>, then try to run <i>mt.cgi</i> again.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>
<h2><a name="perl modules cannot be loaded"></a>Perl modules cannot be loaded</h2>
<p>If, when running any of the Movable Type CGI scripts, you receive an error
that says <code>Can't locate Some/File.pm in @INC</code>, where <i>Some/File.pm</i> is the
name of a file, you should try the following to fix this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
First, you should run <i>mt-check.cgi</i> to ensure that all of the Perl modules
required for Movable Type usage are installed on your webserver. If they are
not, follow the instructions in the <a href="./mtinstall.html">Installation Documentation</a>.
<p></p>
<li>
Check to make sure that in the directory containing your CGI files (for
example, <i>mt.cgi</i>), there is a directory called <i>lib</i>; inside that the file
in the error message (for example, <i>Some/File.pm</i>) should exist. For example,
with the above error message, the file <i>lib/Some/File.pm</i> should exist.
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the file names are case sensitive, so a directory called <i>Lib</i>,
for example, will not work. Likewise <i>some/file.pm</i> is not the same thing
as <i>Some/File.pm</i>; the latter will work, but the former will not.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>
<h2><a name="images, styles, and documentation do not show up"></a>Images, styles, and documentation do not show up</h2>
<p>If, when you first view Movable Type, the images and styles do not show up
properly in your browser, you will need to move the images, documentation,
and stylesheet to a different location. The reason for this is that you
installed Movable Type into your <i>cgi-bin</i> directory, because--presumably--it
was necessary to do so on your server. But hosting non-CGI files out of the
<i>cgi-bin</i> directory causes problems, because the webserver sometimes tries to
execute the images, as if they were programs.</p>
<p>To fix this, you will need to re-upload the images directory (<i>images</i>), the
documentation directory (<i>docs</i>), and the stylesheet (<i>styles.css</i>) to a
different directory, <i>outside</i> of your <i>cgi-bin</i> directory. Then, edit the
<i>mt.cfg</i> file, and add this line:</p>
<pre>StaticWebPath /path/to/dir/
</pre><p>where <i>/path/to/dir/</i> is the URL to the directory containing <i>images</i> and
<i>styles.css</i>. For example, if <i>images</i> is located at
<i>/movable-static/images/</i>, you would use</p>
<pre>StaticWebPath /movable-static/
</pre><p>This should fix the problem.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="i keep getting the movable type login screen"></a>I keep getting the Movable Type login screen</h2>
<p>The problem: you log in to the system and get the <code>Main Menu</code>; but every
link you click on that screen brings you back to the login screen.</p>
<p>The reason for this is likely that you have cookies disabled in your browser.
Movable Type uses a cookie to store your authentication credentials; in this
cookie, your password is one-way encrypted, so this is not a security risk.
If you do not allow this cookie, however, Movable Type has no way of knowing
that you have already successfully logged in, so it will present you with a
login prompt when you try to do anything.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, you will need to enable cookies in your browser.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="i can't logout!"></a>I can't logout!</h2>
<p>The problem: you are logged in to Movable Type; then you logout, and try to
login as another user (for example). But you are still logged in as yourself.</p>
<p>This is probably due to your browser having several versions of the Movable
Type login cookie. The reason this might happen is that the cookie is dependent
on the domain name; so if you have two different domain names that access the
same Movable Type installation, and you use both to get there, you will get
two versions of the Movable Type cookie. If one domain name is a substring of
the other domain name--for example, if one domain is <code>www.foo.com</code>, and the
other is <code>foo.com</code>--then you will need to log out of both sessions in order
to truly logout. To do this, load Movable Type on both domains, and log out
of both sessions.</p>
<p>Because of this, if possible it makes sense to always access Movable Type
through one single domain name.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="my php output files need to be executable"></a>My PHP output files need to be executable</h2>
<p>If you are generating PHP files through Movable Type, some webservers will
require that the generated files have the execute bit set (in other words,
that the permissions are at least <code>755</code>). By default all files created by
the system will have their permissions set to <code>666</code>, and you will receive
errors about your files not being executable.</p>
<p>To fix this, add this line to your <i>mt.cfg</i> file:</p>
<pre>HTMLPerms 0777
</pre><p>This will set the <strong>default</strong> permissions for all files created by the
system to <code>777</code>; note that if you are using the <i>HTMLUmask</i> setting in
<i>mt.cfg</i>, the setting for <i>HTMLPerms</i> will be adjusted by the umask setting.
For example, if you have set <i>HTMLPerms</i> to <code>0777</code>, and you set <i>HTMLUmask</i>
to <code>0022</code>, all files created by the system will have permissions of <code>0755</code>.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="i never receive email notifications for comments"></a>I never receive email notifications for comments</h2>
<p>NOTE: another symptom of this problem is that notification messages sent
through the <code>Edit an entry</code> screen never reach the members of your
notification list.</p>
<p>If you know that users are posting comments on your site, and you are not
receiving them, you should first check your weblog configuration to ensure that
<code>Email new comments?</code> is checked.</p>
<p>If it is, then this is most likely a problem with the path to the <i>sendmail</i>
program on your webserver; this is the program used to send email. Movable
Type looks in three locations for <i>sendmail</i>: <i>/usr/lib/sendmail</i>,
<i>/usr/sbin/sendmail</i>, and <i>/usr/ucblib/sendmail</i>. These are the three most
common locations for <i>sendmail</i> on Unix machines. If your version of
<i>sendmail</i> is at a different location, here are instructions for telling
Movable Type what that location is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Determine the location of <i>sendmail</i> on your webserver. You may need to ask
your hosting provider or system administrator for this information.
<p></p>
<li>
In the directory where you installed Movable Type, there is a file called
<i>mt.cfg</i>; download that file, and open it in an editor. (If you are
comfortable with the shell, you do not need to download the file, but can
instead edit it in <i>vi</i> or another editor of your choosing.)
<p></p>
<li>
Add this line to the file:
<pre>SendMailPath /path/to/sendmail
</pre><p>where <code>/path/to/sendmail</code> is the path to <i>sendmail</i> that you determined in
Step 1.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
Save <i>mt.cfg</i>, and re-upload it to your server. Ensure that you upload the
file in ASCII (text) format. (If you used the shell to edit the file, you can
skip this step.)
<p></p></ol>
<p>That's it; if the location to <i>sendmail</i> is correct, you should now be able
to receive email notifications of new comments.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="my webserver doesn't have sendmail"></a>My webserver doesn't have sendmail</h2>
<p>If you have tried the above steps to get <i>sendmail</i> working, or if you know
that your webserver doesn't have <i>sendmail</i>--for example, Win32 machines
do not have <i>sendmail</i>--Movable Type allows you to send email messages
through SMTP. To do this, you will need to install the <i>Mail::Sendmail</i> Perl
module; if you are on Win32 machines, you can do this using Activestate's
<i>ppm</i> tool. Launch <i>ppm</i>, then at the prompt, type</p>
<pre>install Mail::Sendmail
</pre><p>and <i>ppm</i> will do all of the work to install the module. If you are on a
non-Win32 machine, and you need (or prefer) to use SMTP, you can download
the distribution from here:</p>
<pre>http://www.movabletype.org/cpan/cpan-Mail-Sendmail.tar.gz
</pre><p>Unpack the archive using an extraction program, then connect via FTP to your
webserver. Open the directory where you installed Movable Type, then open the
<i>extlib</i> directory; then create a new directory called <code>Mail</code>. Then open
the <code>Mail</code> directory, and upload the file <i>Sendmail.pm</i> from the archive
into the <code>Mail</code> directory.</p>
<p>After you have installed <i>Mail::Sendmail</i>, you will need to configure Movable
Type to send mail using SMTP. To do so, edit your <i>mt.cfg</i> file, and add
the line</p>
<pre>MailTransfer smtp
</pre><p>By default, Movable Type will try to use the SMTP server on the webserver (on
<code>localhost</code>); if you need to change this, add another line</p>
<pre>SMTPServer address.of.smtp.server
</pre><p>Save (and re-upload, if necessary) your <i>mt.cfg</i> file, and you're done.
Movable Type should now send email through the SMTP server.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="my host doesn't have image::magick"></a>My host doesn't have Image::Magick</h2>
<p>Some hosts do not have the <i>Image::Magick</i> Perl module, which Movable Type
uses to create thumbnails of uploaded images. As of version 2.3 of Movable
Type, the system now supports an alternate method of creating thumbnails,
using the NetPBM suite of tools. If your system has NetPBM but not
Image::Magick, you'll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_Install_IPC%3A%3ARun"></a>Install IPC::Run</strong><br>

You'll need to install the <i>IPC::Run</i> Perl module, which Movable Type
uses to talk to the NetPBM tools. Download the file at this URL:
<pre>http://www.movabletype.org/cpan/cpan-IPC-Run.tar.gz
</pre><p>On your FTP server, create a new folder called <i>IPC</i> within your
<i>extlib</i> folder. Then upload the <i>Run.pm</i> file and the <i>Run</i> folder
from the <i>IPC-Run</i> distribution into the <i>IPC</i> folder on your server.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_Edit_mt%2Ecfg"></a>Edit mt.cfg</strong><br>

Edit your <i>mt.cfg</i> file, and add this line
<pre>ImageDriver NetPBM
</pre><p>By default, Movable Type will look for the NetPBM tools in one of the
following locations: <i>/usr/local/netpbm/bin</i>, <i>/usr/local/bin</i>, or
<i>/usr/bin</i>. If you need to set a different path, add another line to
<i>mt.cfg</i>:</p>
<pre>NetPBMPath /path/to/netpbm
</pre><p>Save (and re-upload, if necessary) your <i>mt.cfg</i> file, and you're done.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>If your host does not have NetPBM, or if you run your own server, you can
download and install the NetPBM suite of tools from
<i><a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/</a></i>. If you'd prefer (or need) the
precompiled binaries, the Gallery developers provide a set of
binaries which can be downloaded from
<i><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130</a></i>.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="i get an error about .new files when rebuilding"></a>I get an error about <i>.new</i> files when rebuilding</h2>
<p>When rebuilding a page, Movable Type first writes the page data to a temp
file, then renames the temp file to the actual file name. The temp file is
named with an extension of <i>.new</i>; for example, if the file <i>index.html</i>
is being rebuilt, the temp file would be named <i>index.html.new</i>. Movable
Type does this to prevent corruption of your public files; if, for some
reason, the rebuild process is killed in the middle of writing data to a file,
that file will not be complete, and will appear corrupted to a web browser.</p>
<p>The process of writing to temp files requires that permissions on the
<code>Local Site Path</code> directory be set to 777; some users can not--or would
rather not--set the permissions this liberally, and will then receive errors
when Movable Type is unable to write to the <i>.new</i> temp files. If this is
the case for you, you can turn off the use of temp files. To do so, edit
your <i>mt.cfg</i> file, and add the line</p>
<pre>NoTempFiles 1
</pre><p>This will tell Movable Type not to write data to temp files, and you should
no longer receive errors when rebuilding.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="movable type encodes the characters in my language incorrectly"></a>Movable Type encodes the characters in my language incorrectly</h2>
<p>When encoding characters into HTML entities--either for editing, or when
you use the <i>encode_html</i> global tag attribute--Movable Type uses the
<i>HTML::Entities</i> Perl module, if your server has it; otherwise, it uses a
simple encoding that encodes <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, and <code></code>
into the proper entities.</p>
<p>In some cases, however, <i>HTML::Entities</i> will not work properly for your
characters--this may happen, for example, if your characters are encoded in
a different character set (if you are writing in Polish, Russian, etc). In
this case, edit your <i>mt.cfg</i> file, and add the line</p>
<pre>NoHTMLEntities 1
</pre><p>This will tell Movable Type to use its simple encoding, which will not mess
with the special characters you are using.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="i don't like the 404 error page that comes with mt"></a>I don't like the <code>404</code> error page that comes with MT</h2>
<p>The Movable Type distribution includes a file <i>index.html</i> in the main
Movable Type directory; when you upload this file to your webserver, it
prevents users from viewing the contents of the directory listing. This is
not meant to provide bulletproof security, but it keeps away curious viewers.</p>
<p>The version that ships with Movable Type is rather plain, so if you'd like to
improve it on your server, just edit the file <i>index.html</i>; it's just a
standard HTML file.</p>
<p>If you are using Apache as your webserver, you can use a different technique
to prevent users from viewing your directory listings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Create a file <i>.htaccess</i> in the directory where you installed Movable Type.
<p></p>
<li>
Open that file in an editor.
<p></p>
<li>
Add the line <code>Options -Indexes</code> to that file.
<p></p>
<li>
Save the file, then exit the editor.
<p></p></ol>
<p>If you use this technique, you can remove the <i>index.html</i> file from the
directory; the webserver will then prevent viewers from listing the contents
of the directory.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="i changed hosts, and now i can't log in to movable type."></a>I changed hosts, and now I can't log in to Movable Type.</h2>
<p>When you change hosting providers (or just move to a different server at the
same provider), it is possible that the two servers have different versions
of the Berkeley DB library; this is the library that Movable Type uses to
store your data. When you copy the DB files from one host to another, if the
two hosts have different versions of Berkeley DB, the new host will not be
able to read the files from the old host.</p>
<p>This can be fixed by converting the DB files over to the format used by the
new library version; this is accomplished in several different ways, depending
on the Berkeley DB versions involved. The files that need to be converted are
all of the files in your <i>db</i> directory whose filenames end in either <i>.db</i>
or <i>.idx</i> (the <i>.lock</i> files do not need to be converted).</p>
<p>The following steps require that you have shell access to your server, and
imply that you are somewhat familiar with running Unix commands; if this is
not the case, you should ask your hosting provider to help you.</p>
<ol>
<li>
First, and most important, back up your DB files; you need to create backup
copies of all of the files in your <i>db</i> directory. (If you do this by
downloading the directory, make sure to transfer it in binary mode.)
<p></p>
<li>
The easiest way to convert the DB files is to use the <i>db_upgrade</i> program;
unfortunately this is not available on every server, but it may be available
on yours. To find out, log into your shell account, and type the following at
your shell prompt (&lt;db_dir&gt; is the path to your <i>db</i> directory):
<pre>$ cd &lt;db_dir&gt;
$ db_upgrade *.db *.idx
</pre><p>If your server has <i>db_upgrade</i>, this will convert all of your DB files over
to the new format. If this works, you're done, and you can skip the following
steps; Movable Type should now work.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
If the above <i>db_upgrade</i> command does not work--for example, if you get an
error saying that <code>command not found</code>--then you will need to use the following
method to convert your data. This method dumps out all of the data from your
DB files, then loads it into new versions of those DB files.
<p>The program used to dump the contents of your DB files is called either one of
two things: <i>db_dump</i>, or <i>db_dump185</i>. To determine which program you need
to use, first try running the following command in your shell account:</p>
<pre>$ cd &lt;db_dir&gt;
$ db_dump author.db
</pre><p>If this command is successful, you will see a screenful of data dumped out. If
it is unsuccessful, you will get an error message; in this case, try using
the following command:</p>
<pre>$ db_dump185 author.db
</pre><p>Again, if the command is successful, you will see a screenful of data. If this
also fails, then you will need to contact your hosting provider.</p>
<p></p>
<li>
Now that you have determined which <i>db_dump</i> program to use (either <i>db_dump</i>
or <i>db_dump185</i>), you can dump all of the data from your old DBM files and
load it into new versions of those files. To do that, try the following
(substitute <i>db_dump185</i> instead of <i>db_dump</i>, if necessary):
<pre>$ db_dump -f author.db.data author.db
$ mv author.db author.db.old
$ db_load -f author.db.data author.db
$ chmod 666 author.db
</pre><p>You will need to run these four commands for each file in your <i>db</i> directory
whose name ends in <i>.db</i> or <i>.idx</i>. After you have done so, you're done,
and Movable Type should now work.</p>
