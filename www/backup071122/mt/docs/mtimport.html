<p>mtimport - Movable Type Import Format</p>
<p>
<hr size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
<h1><a name="synopsis"></a>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>This document describes the format required by the Movable Type import
mechanism, which can be used to import entries and comments from other content
management systems.</p>
<p>
<hr size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
<h1><a name="description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The basic import format is a list of entries, separated by the string
<code>--------\n</code> (that is eight <code>-</code> characters, followed by a carriage return).
Each entry can be broken into two main sections; these sections are
separated by the string <code>-----\n</code> (that is five <code>-</code> characters, followed
by a carriage return).</p>
<p>If you have HTML in the data that you are importing, it should <strong>not</strong> be
encoded into HTML entities; the data that is in your import file is imported
verbatim into the Movable Type database. Thus, your data should look exactly
as it would were you to type it into the form when creating a new entry.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Metadata"></a>Metadata</strong><br>

<li><strong><a name="item_fields"></a>Multi-line fields (Body, Extended Body, Excerpt, Comments)</strong><br>

</ul>
<p>See <a href="#example">EXAMPLE</a>, below, for an example of a small import file.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="metadata"></a>Metadata</h2>
<p>Each piece of metadata is formatted as <code>KEY: VALUE</code>, and one piece of
metadata is separated from the next by a carriage return. The order of the
metadata pieces is not important.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>AUTHOR: Foo Bar
TITLE: A dummy title
DATE: 01/31/2002 03:31:05 PM
CATEGORY: News
</pre><ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_AUTHOR"></a>AUTHOR</strong><br>

The author of the entry.
<p>If the author name does not exist, a new <i>MT::Author</i> record will be created,
and the author will be assigned posting permissions to the weblog into which
you're importing the entries. The entry will then be assigned to the new
author. If the author name does exist, the entry will be assigned to the
existing author.</p>
<p>This is ignored if you have checked the <code>Import entries as me</code> checkbox
before importing; it is required otherwise.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_TITLE"></a>TITLE</strong><br>

The title of the entry.
<p>If you do not specify a title, a title will be generated automatically from
the first five (<code>5</code>) words in the entry body.</p>
<p>This is optional.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_DATE"></a>DATE</strong><br>

The authored-on date of the entry.
<p>This should be in the format <code>MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM|PM</code>. <code>AM|PM</code> is
optional, and if not present the <code>hh</code> will be intrepreted as being in
military time.</p>
<p>This is required.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_PRIMARY_CATEGORY"></a>PRIMARY CATEGORY</strong><br>

The primary category to which the entry is assigned.
<p>If the category name does not exist, a new <i>MT::Category</i> record will be
created, and the entry will be assigned to the new category. If the category
name does exist, the entry will be assigned to the existing category.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_CATEGORY"></a>CATEGORY</strong><br>

A secondary category to which the entry is assigned. Multiple <i>CATEGORY</i>
keys can appear in the metadata section; each specifies a secondary category.
For example:
<pre>CATEGORY: Foo
CATEGORY: Bar
</pre><p>If the category name does not exist, a new <i>MT::Category</i> record will be
created, and the entry will be assigned to the new category. If the category
name does exist, the entry will be assigned to the existing category.</p>
<p>If the category specified in <i>PRIMARY CATEGORY</i> is also listed as a
<i>CATEGORY</i>, it will be dropped from the list of secondary categories
automatically, and will be set as the primary category.</p>
<p>If you do not provide a <i>PRIMARY CATEGORY</i>, but you do provide one or more
secondary categories via <i>CATEGORY</i>, the first <i>CATEGORY</i> will be used as
a primary category rather than as a category.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_STATUS"></a>STATUS</strong><br>

The post status of the entry. Valid values are either <code>draft</code> or <code>publish</code>.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_ALLOW_COMMENTS"></a>ALLOW COMMENTS</strong><br>

The value for the ``allow comments'' flag for the entry. Valid values are either
<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_ALLOW_PINGS"></a>ALLOW PINGS</strong><br>

The value for the ``allow pings'' flag for the entry. Valid values are either
<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_CONVERT_BREAKS"></a>CONVERT BREAKS</strong><br>

The value for the ``convert breaks'' flag for the entry. Valid values are either
<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_NO_ENTRY"></a>NO ENTRY</strong><br>

A special key used when importing data from a system where you have already
imported all of the entries, but <strong>not</strong> the comments. If you use this, the
<i>DATE</i> key is required, and will be used to look up the entries with which
the comments are associated; if a matching entry cannot be found by matching
the timestamps, the comments will be skipped. You probably don't need to use
this.
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre>NO ENTRY: 1
</pre><p></p></ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="multiline fields"></a>Multi-line fields</h2>
<p>Multi-line fields are separated by <code>-----\n</code> (that is five <code>-</code> characters,
followed by a carriage return). Each multi-line field is started by the key
denoting the type of field, followed by a carriage return, followed by the
actual body of the field.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>BODY:
